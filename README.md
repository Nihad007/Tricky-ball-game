## Introduction

This project is designed to explore 3D visualization and physics simulations using **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber (R3F)**, and various related libraries. The setup utilizes modern tools like **Vite** for fast development, **React** for component-based architecture, and **Zustand** for state management.

The goal of this repository is to experiment with different **Three.js** concepts and learn how to integrate them with **React** using **React Three Fiber**.

---

## Features

- **3D rendering** using **Three.js**
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)** for rendering 3D scenes within React components
- **React Three Drei** for simplified Three.js functionality in React
- **Physics simulation** using **Rapier.js** integrated via R3F
- **Post-processing effects** with **React Three Postprocessing**
- **Performance optimizations** with **r3f-perf**

---

## Setup

Follow the steps below to set up your local development environment:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. You can verify this by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
### Install

To install required packages, use:
```bash
npm install
```

### Build
To build the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Development
To start the development server, use the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start a local development server, typically available at http://localhost. Any changes made to the project will automatically trigger a live reload.

### Dependencies
This project uses the following dependencies:

Core Libraries
React (react and react-dom): For building the UI components.

Three.js (three): The core 3D rendering library used for creating 3D objects and scenes.

React Three Fiber Libraries
@react-three/fiber: A React renderer for Three.js that allows you to build 3D scenes with React components.

@react-three/drei: A collection of useful helpers for React Three Fiber.

@react-three/postprocessing: For adding post-processing effects like bloom, depth of field, and more to your 3D scenes.

@react-three/rapier: Physics simulation with the Rapier engine integrated into React Three Fiber.

r3f-perf: A performance optimization library for React Three Fiber, helping you monitor and optimize your 3D scenes.

### Development Tools
Vite: A fast and modern build tool for web projects, used here to bundle the app and provide live development features.

Vite Plugin Restart: Automatically restarts Vite when there are changes to specific files, providing an improved development experience.

@vitejs/plugin-react: Vite plugin to support React features.

### State Management
Zustand: A small, fast state management library that integrates seamlessly with React for managing app state.
